# Route messages from defined remote hosts into log files based on
# the name of the remote host. The parts of this rule are:
# - ":" indicates that this is a property-based filter (traditionally
#   the filter would be a severity/facility based selector)
# - "hostname" names the property whose value should be examined
# - "," a simple separator
# - "ereregex" indicates the compare-operation, in this case that the
#   property value should be compared against an extended regular
#   expression (another compare-operation is "isequal")
# - "," a simple separator
# - "(host1|host2|...)" the regular expression to compare against
# - "?" indicates that the action is a dynamic filename (as opposed
#   to static files that must be specified starting with a "/")
# - "RemoteHostLogfile" is the name of the template that must be
#   evaluated to get the actual filename
# - "&" on a new line indicates that for the same filter rule there
#   is another action coming up
# - "~" is the "discard" action, i.e. the message is not processed
#   any further
